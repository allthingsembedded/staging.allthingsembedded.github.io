They make code reuse easier and also help with reasoning if the abstraction is high-level enough.
Today we are going to talk about static_ptr from the library Ditto. Dynamic allocation is often forbidden when developing embedded systems. This leads to allocating most things either in the stack or globally. A static_ptr allows the user to statically allocate an object of a derived class and access it as a base class pointer.</description></item></channel></rss>
